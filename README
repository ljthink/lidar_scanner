# 3D Lidar scanner in python using a hoyuko lidar system

The goal of this is to attach a servo to a lidar system, turning a 2d lidar system into a 3d lidar system.
The driver libraries are a pain in the ass to build, you can rebuild them by roughly following this:

	# Install flexiport https://github.com/gbiggs/flexiport

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ../ -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=OFF
	make
	# Must make install, cmake config is bad and cannot
	# point to artifact dir directly
	make install

	# Build boost from source
	# Make SURE that the user-config.jam file is copied
	# to your home directory, and you have specified your
	# target python version and path in said user-config

	# build boost
	./bootstrap.sh --with-python
	./b2 --with-python
	# at this point you should have produced a shared lib for boost

	# Install the lidar lib https://github.com/gbiggs/hokuyoaist
	mkdir build && cd build
	# Make sure you change the path to your boost link path, 
	# flexiport root path, and target python path
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/$USER/boost/boost_1_65_1/stage/lib" CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:/home/$USER/flexiport/" cmake ../ -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=OFF -DBOOST_ROOT=~/boost/boost_1_65_1
	-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/python3
	 
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/home/$USER/boost/boost_1_65_1/stage/lib" make

	# Ensure built library is correct binary header type 
	# (ELF32 ARM EABI5 or ELF64 amd64)
	file build/python/hoyukoaist.so
